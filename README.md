This project was to design an etch-a-sketch. It was extremely fun and solidified what I had learned about how to manipulate the DOM. Figuring out the grid squares themselves was difficult, but once I got past that, I was able to go from there, step by step.

I hope you enjoy my project, I enjoyed coding it!
